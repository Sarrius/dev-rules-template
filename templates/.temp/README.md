# Temporary Files

This directory is for temporary files that don't fit in the scope of the current task.

## Purpose

- Store drafts and experimental code
- Keep temporary snippets
- Hold work-in-progress files
- Isolate exploratory work from production code

## Guidelines

- Files in this directory should not be committed to version control
- Once incorporated into the main codebase, files should be removed from this directory
- Use this directory to experiment without affecting the main codebase

## Lifecycle

1. Create exploratory code in this directory
2. Test and refine until ready for production
3. Move to appropriate location in the main codebase
4. Remove from this directory
